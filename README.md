Summary of App Requirements and Goals

The goal of the app was to create a functional inventory management system that allows users to log in, manage inventory items, and receive SMS alerts based on inventory status. This app was designed to address user needs for easy item tracking, quick data updates, and effective communication through alerts.

UI Design and User-Centered Features

To meet user needs, I developed several screens: a login screen, a data display grid, an add/edit/delete inventory item screen, and an SMS permission request screen. I kept the UI simple, intuitive, and consistent to ensure ease of use. My design choices, such as clear buttons, readable text, and streamlined navigation, helped users quickly achieve their goals, making the app user-friendly and accessible.

Coding Approach and Techniques

I approached coding by breaking the project into smaller tasks: setting up the SQLite database, building the login authentication, creating CRUD operations, and handling SMS permissions. I used modular coding practices and frequent testing to catch errors early. These strategies helped keep the code organized and can be reused in future projects for maintaining scalability and troubleshooting efficiently.

Testing and Importance

I tested the app by manually interacting with each feature (login, CRUD actions, and SMS functionality) and used Logcat in Android Studio to monitor background processes. This testing ensured that each function worked properly and revealed minor bugs that were easily fixed. Testing was crucial for validating the app’s reliability and usability before final submission.

Overcoming Challenges

One challenge I faced was managing SMS permission handling based on different Android API levels. I innovated by implementing runtime permission checks and fallback messages when permissions were denied, ensuring smooth user experience across devices.

Key Success Areas

I was particularly successful in demonstrating my skills in SQLite database integration and CRUD functionality. Setting up a reliable, efficient database allowed for smooth data management, and the user-friendly UI ensured that these operations felt seamless to the end-user.
